# Kintsugi Experiments: Case Study on CrazyFlie 2.0


This directory contains all the necessary sources and data for the Crazyflie 2.0 case study from our paper. We provide all the necessary toolings to perform the study to plot the yaw value.

**Important: Do NOT connect using `screen` or anything to the UART, the scripts take care of this.**

How to perform measurements:
- Run the experiment script `bash ./run.sh` to perform the experiment

This will also plot the retrieved data.
